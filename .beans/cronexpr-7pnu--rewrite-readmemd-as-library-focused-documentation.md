Replace the current cron-tutorial-style README with a library-focused document covering: API, usage examples, supported formats, extensions, aliases, and limitations.

## Summary of Changes\n\nRewrote README.md from a cron-tutorial style to a library-focused document. New structure: one-liner description, install instructions, usage examples (Parse, MustParse, Next, NextN, IsZero, timezone preservation), supported format table (5/6/7 fields), extensions list (L, W, LW, #, wrap-around ranges, names), aliases table, limitations, and license.
